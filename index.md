# 👩🏼‍💻 Technical Experience   

## Natural Language Processing

**Sentiment Analysis**

   I have a good command of various mathematical algorithms for sentiment analysis(text classification). I have used Python to implement traditional dictionary-based sentiment analysis. I have also used *PyTorch* to do some deep learning sentiment analysis. For example, reproducing text-CNN and Bert models in the sentiment analysis task. My new paper using the deep sentiment analysis model and empirical experiment is under peer review.

**Automatic Summarization**

   I am familiar with two kinds of automatic summarization techniques, namely, extraction summarization and generation summarization. The relevant project shows [here](https://github.com/downw/summrization).

## Agent Based Modelling

In my opinion, agent-based modelling is a good tool to simulate complex social and economic problems. I have built a two-layer network, including emotion and health, to study the emotional impact of the epidemic on people in the context of the Internet. The paper can click [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/9933720/).

## Econometric Analysis

I have written some examples of how to use R for panel data regression. These blogs are mainly based on the *PLM* package for R. These examples include model testing and interpretation of regression results. Blogs are [here](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43718786/category_10538680.html?spm=1001.2014.3001.5482) (in Chinese).

## Complex Network

This is one of my current research directions for my degree, and I am currently studying it. I am interested in super networks (also calls network of networks, multi-layers networks).
