## ## Natural Language Processing

1. Sentiment Analysis

   I have a good command of various mathematical algorithms for sentiment analysis(text classification). I have used Python to implement traditional dictionary-based sentiment analysis. I have also used PyTorch to do some deep learning sentiment analysis. For example, reproducing text-CNN and Bert models in the sentiment analysis task. My new paper using the deep sentiment analysis model proposed by myself is under peer review.

2. Automatic Summarization
